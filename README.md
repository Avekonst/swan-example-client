## Installing
For installation, follow the instructions on the [project repository](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-todo).

## Build tasks

### Bundle

The contents of this directory can be uploaded and served to visitors.

### Watch
Transpiles to .dev (the new "dist"). This has been optimized in performance (no unneeded copying of files).
